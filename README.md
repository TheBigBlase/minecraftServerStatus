# Discord bot 
displays activity of minecraft server running on localhost:25565 (default minecraft port)
written in ts, so you gotta compile it before running it. You'll also need a settings.json file : 

### Instalation 
```
git clone https://github.com/thebigblase/minecraftserverstatus
npm install
```
Next, you'll need to put your token inside a settings.json file, like so : 
```json
{
	"token":"YOUR TOKEN HERE"
}
```
Finaly, run it with : 
```
npm run start
```

### notes 
The code is a little spaghetti but hey first time using TS
gl & hf
